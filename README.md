# APComputerScience-Projects
a collection of projects I did for my AP Computer Science class 2019-2020   
    
Christmas Countdown:    
returns the number of days until Christmas (12/25). If run on Christmas itself, it should return 0.     

Min and Max:    
prompts the user to enter five integers. The program should then print out the smallest and largest integers, on separate lines and preceded by labels as illustrated below.    

Coins:      
ask the user to enter the number of cents. The number of cents is guaranteed to be between 1 and 99, inclusive. The output should be how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies (in that order) they would need to be returned as change for $1. Each type of coin should be labeled and on its own line. If a particular coin is not required, it should be omitted from the output. The number of coins should be the minimum possible amount.    

Digits:     
inputs one number consisting of four digits. The number is guaranteed to be between 1000 and 9999, inclusive. The program should then output the sum and product of the digits of the number.
