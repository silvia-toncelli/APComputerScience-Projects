# APComputerScience-Projects
a collection of projects I did for my AP Computer Science class 2019-2020   
    
Christmas Countdown:    
returns the number of days until Christmas (12/25). If run on Christmas itself, it should return 0.     

Min and Max:    
prompts the user to enter five integers. The program should then print out the smallest and largest integers, on separate lines and preceded by labels as illustrated below.
